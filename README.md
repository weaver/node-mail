# Node Mail #

This SMTP client helps you send email safely and easily using
Node.JS. It supports TLS and auth-login so you can send through
gmail. It also implements sanity checks to safeguard against header
injection attacks.

## Installation ##

Use NPM to install:

    npm install mail

## Sending Mail ##

The `Mail` class encapsulates connection settings and can be used as a
safe, high-level mailer.

    var mail = require('mail').Mail({
      host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
      username: 'me@gmail.com',
      password: '**password**'
    });

Use the mailer to send messages:

    mail.message({
      from: 'sender@example.net',
      to: ['recipient@somewhere.org'],
      subject: 'Hello from Node.JS'
    })
    .body('Node speaks SMTP!')
    .send(function(err) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('Sent!');
    });

## Mail(options) ##

Create a new mailer that can be used to send messages.  Common options
include:

  + `host`: server hostname
  + `username`: user for server authentication
  + `password`: password for server authentication,

Other options:

  + `secure`: `true`, `false`, or crypto credentials (default: `true`)
  + `port`: server listens on this port (default: 587 or 25)
  + `domain`: the domain of the sender (default: `os.hostname()`)
  + `mimeTransport`: `7BIT` or `8BITMIME` (default: `8BITMIME`)
  + `timeout`: timeout for server connection (default: no timeout)

### Mail.message(headers) ###

Begin a `MailTransaction`.  The `headers` object may contain any any
SMTP headers.  When the message is formatted, email addresses are
validated, header names are title-cased, and header values escaped to
prevent injection.  A `Date` header is automatically added.

An email address may be an array, a single address, or a string with
command-separated addresses.  Individual addresses may be bare or in
the format `"Display Name" <name@example.net>`.

### MailTransaction.body(text) ###

Add a body to a mail transaction.  Long lines are automatically
wrapped.

### MailTransaction.send(callback) ###

Connect to the server, transmit the message, and quit.  The callback
should be in the form `function(err, message) { ... }`.  Upon success,
`err` is `null` and `message` is set to the `Message` object that was
sent to the server.

## Compatibility ##

Node Mail has been tested against [qmail][1] and [gmail][2] using Node
version `v0.4.3`.  A working subset of these RFCs are supported:

  + [Internet Message Format](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322)
  + [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321)
  + [Authentication Extension](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2554)
  + [SMTP Transport Layer Security](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3207)
  + [8-bit MIME Transport](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6152)

There is not currently direct support for multipart messages or
attachments, although `node-mail` will send messages in this format if
they're build manually.
